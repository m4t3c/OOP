     It is possible to get an estimate of the mathematical constant π by using a random process.
     The idea is based on the fact that the area of a circle of radius 1 is equal to π,
     and the area of a quarter of that circle is π/4.

     The area of the square is 1, while the area of the part inside the circle is π/4.
     If we choose a point in the square at random, the probability that it is inside the circle is π/4.
     If we choose N points in the square at random (see Math.random()), and if C of them are inside the circle,
     we expect the fraction C/N of points that fall inside the circle to be about π/4.
     If N is large enough, we can expect 4 * C/N to be a good estimate for π.
     Write a program producing increasingly accurate estimates of PI as reported below
